# Ring [![Build Status](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Ring is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI
and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple,
unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular
components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web
servers, and web frameworks.

The [SPEC.md][1] file at the root of this distribution provides a
complete description of the Ring interface. The [Wiki][2] contains
more in-depth documentation on how to use Ring.

## Libraries

* `ring/ring` - meta-package containing all relevant dependencies
* `ring/ring-core` - core functions and middleware for Ring handlers,
  requests and responses
* `org.clojure/ring-websocket-protocols` - contains only the protocols
  necessary for the WebSocket API
* `ring/ring-devel` - functions for developing and debugging Ring
  applications
* `ring/ring-servlet` - construct legacy Java Servlets (≤ 4.0) from Ring
  handlers
* `org.ring-clojure/ring-jakarta-servlet` construct
  [Jakarta Servlets][3] (≥ 5.0) from Ring handlers
* `ring/ring-jetty-adapter` - a Ring adapter that uses an embedded
  [Jetty][4] web server
